# Popularity of Names over the Years

This is my first coding project I have completed from scratch. The input is speaking your name 
and which provinces you would like to see and the output is a distribution of how many people has
the same name as you depending on the year they were born. In some provinces like Ontario, this 
spans over 100 years. 

Again being my first project, there are many errors and it is not a prefectly written code. If you
have any suggestions let me know.

Thank you
